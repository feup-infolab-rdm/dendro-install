#	Dendro automated installation scripts

This package allows you to install the Dendro platform. It is a completely open-source platform designed to help researchers describe their datasets, fully build on Linked Open Data.

It is under development at [Faculdade de Engenharia da Universidade do Porto](https://www.fe.up.pt/)'s [Infolab](http://infolab.fe.up.pt) since 2013.

If you are interested in the academic foundations and innovations behind Dendro, please check out our publications at the [Dendro official website](http://dendro.fe.up.pt).

You are free to use the source code in a commercial product or service.
